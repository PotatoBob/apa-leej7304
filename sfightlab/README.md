## Starfighter Lab
#### Welcome to Starfighter!
   In this game, you play as a ship trying to defend your base (at the bottom of the screen) from aliens!  
   The aliens spawn at the top of the screen and shuffle before slowly moving down.  
   They will move left or right until they hit the side, then they will go down and then switch directions.  
   You goal is to shoot all of the aliens before they can get to the bottom.  
   If you can kill all the aliens before they get to your base, you win!  
   If any of the aliens get to the bottom before you can kill them, you lose!  
   Control the ship using the arrow keys, and fire using space.
