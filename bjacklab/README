Welcome to Blackjack!
To begin, both the player and dealer will be dealt 2 cards.
The player's cards are public, while the dealer's cards will remain hidden until later.
The player has the option to 'hit', or be dealt another card.
The goal is to get as close to 21, but not over, as possible.
If the player goes over 21, then the player 'busts', and loses.
In this game, face cards are all worth 10.
Aces are worth 11, but will change to 1 if the player would 'bust' otherwise.
Once the player decides to 'stand', or stop getting cards, then it is the dealer's turn.
The dealer will then reveal its cards, then is required to 'hit' until its hand total is greater than or equal to 17.
If the dealer 'busts', then the player wins.
If the dealer 'stands' and the player and dealer have the same hand total, then the game ends in a tie.
Otherwise, whoever has the higher hand total wins.
