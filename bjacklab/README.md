## Welcome to Blackjack!
   To begin, select how many players (other than the dealer) will be playing.  
   All players' cards are public, while the dealer only reveals one card until later.  
   In turn, each player will have the option to 'hit', or be dealt another card.  
   If that player's hand total goes over 21, then that player 'busts', and loses the game.  
   In this game, all face cards are worth 10.  
   Aces are initially worth 11, but if a player has an ace and would 'bust' otherwise, the ace changes value to 1.  
   Once the player decides to 'stand', or stop getting cards, then it is the next player's turn.  
   After all players have either 'bust' or choose to 'stand', then it is the dealer's turn.  
   The dealer will then reveal its other card, then is required to 'hit' until its hand total is greater than or equal to 17.  
   If the dealer 'busts', then all players who did not 'bust' this game win.  
   If the dealer 'stands', then players with the same total as the dealer tie, players with a higher total win, and players with a lower total lose.
